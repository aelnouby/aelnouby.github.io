We propose LeVIT: a hybrid neural network for fast inference image classification. We consider different measures of efficiency
on different hardware platforms, so as to best reflect a wide range of application scenarios. Our extensive experiments empirically validate
our technical choices and show they are suitable to most architectures. Overall, LeViT significantly outperforms existing convnets and vision
transformers with respect to the speed/accuracy tradeoff. For example, at 80\% ImageNet top-1 accuracy, LeViT is 3.3 times faster than EfficientNet on the CPU.
