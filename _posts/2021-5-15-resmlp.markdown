We present ResMLP, an architecture built entirely upon multi-layer perceptrons for image classification.
It is a simple residual network that alternates (i) a linear layer in which image patches interact, independently
and identically across channels, and (ii) a two-layer feed-forward network in which channels interact independently per patch.
