We present a real-time end-to-end trainable two-stream network for action detection. First, we integrate the optical flow computation in our framework by using Flownet2. Second, we apply early fusion for the two streams and train the whole pipeline jointly end-to-end. Finally, for better network initialization, we transfer from the task of action recognition to action detection by pre-training our framework using the recently released large-scale Kinetics dataset.
