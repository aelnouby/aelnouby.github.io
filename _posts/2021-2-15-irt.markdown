We adopt vision transformers for generating image descriptors and train the resulting model with a metric learning objective,
which combines a contrastive loss with a differential entropy regularizer. Our results show consistent and significant improvements
of transformers over convolution-based approaches. In particular, our method outperforms the state of the art on several public benchmarks for
category-level retrieval, namely Stanford Online Product, In-Shop and CUB-200.
